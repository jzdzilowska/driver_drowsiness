Figure 1. Network Architecture
Each bar represents a singular layer in the network. Underneath the bar graph, the label for each of the different colors can be found. Bars of the same length vertically have the same number of input neurons and bars of the same thickness horizontally have the same number of output neurons. The figure was generated in the section of the code labled: 
#### Network Architecture. ####


Figure 4. Confusion Matrix for Drowsiness Detection
The left hand side represents the true classification label for each image and the bottom shows the predicted label. The right hand color bar goes from light blue to dark blue as the number of images increases. The Matrix shows that there was a high accuracy because the left to right diagonal has darker blues in comparison to the lighter blues in the remaining spaces. For example, the true classification for not drowsy had 404 predictions of being not drowsy in comparison to the 4 incorrect predictions of neutral and drowsy. The figure was generated in the section of the code labled:
